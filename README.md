# Garfield the log viewer
Garfield, or garf for short, is a console based log viewer written in Java. It utilizes NConsole for console i/o. Under *nix, this means it uses ncursors. Under windows it uses native windows console commands.

**Note** that Windows support isn't in place yet. Plan is to use the same methods as on *nix systems. 

#JNI
See [NConsole](https://github.com/abathur8bit/nconsole) for Java Native Interface (JNI) calls.

# Building/running
Currently tied to nconsole project, and I need to fix up the project to make it so someone else can run it.
